Stupid simple analog trimwheel included here for posterity.

This was one of the first mechanical devices I created. Uses a Digispark ATtny85 microcontroller with a simple 10k potentiometer.
The pot acts as the axle for the trim wheel. The wheel and the case are 3d printed. 

The housing and mounting design are so amateurish I'm not including them here as there are better available elsewhere.
The case looks roughtly like https://www.sportys.com/trimwheel-pro.html
