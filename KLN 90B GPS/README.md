Physical controls, display, and mounting for [falcon71's KLN 90B](https://github.com/falcon71/kln90b) for MSFS.

In June-ish of 2024 A2A added support for the open-source KLN 90B to the Comanche. Although my current radio stack is full, I wanted to add this somehow.

The basic construction of this is "a button box connected by Mobiflight with a small HDMI screen." It's very similar to my G1000 or GNS530.



Hardware:
See the [Hardware Readme](https://github.com/ccrawford/FSHardware/blob/main/KLN%2090B%20GPS/Hardware/README.md)

Software:
- Uses a basic Mobiflight setup. No custom devices or software.
- Mobiflight config files in the [Software Folder](https://github.com/ccrawford/FSHardware/tree/main/KLN%2090B%20GPS/Software)

Other software/tools required:
- Fusion360 to modify the case if needed.
- Mobiflight to connect the hardware to your flight sim computer and MSFS
- Slicer (I use Simplify3D) to get the 3d model ready for printing.
- 3D Printer (I use a FlashForge Creator Pro) and I printed in PLA.

Build steps:
- See the Hardware section.

Mount to allow easy attach/detach from Honeycomb Alpha yoke

ToDo:
As of Sep, 2024, none of these are in progress. It works great as is, although I'm a little concerned about durability.

- Build a better surrounding case to better enclose wiring and support external connectors
- Create a custom PCB to improve rigidity and durability
- Incorporate into my existing Comanche radio stack
- Source a more appropriate display (reduced height)
